Using the .csv file you created for the last challenge, create a program that will allow people to add names and ages to the list and create a button that will display 
the contents of the .csv file by importing it to a list box.

Create a program that will allow the user to create a new .csv file. It should ask them to enter the name and age of a person and then allow them to add this to the end 
of the file they have just created.
